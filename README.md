## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a Data Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute. I have a PhD Government from the University of Essex. I wrote my thesis on the measurement of political ideology. I'm broadly interested in political science, statistics, data science, and programming.

In my spare time outside of work and research projects, I enjoy spending time with my wife, reading, and self-learning general programming. You can learn more about me and my research on my website which you can find [at this link](https://philswatton.github.io/).
